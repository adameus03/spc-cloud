# Update the image in the Azure Container Registry 
For updating production:
```
docker login spccloud.azurecr.io --username spccloud
```
The password is of course not provided here for security reasons. 
If you already created the spccloud.azurecr.io/cloud-node:20-alpine3.17 image, before proceeding, please run
```
$ docker image rm spccloud.azurecr.io/cloud-node:20-alpine3.17
```
Create the docker image for Azure:
```
$ docker build -t spccloud.azurecr.io/cloud-node:20-alpine3.17 .
```
Push the application docker image to the Azure server
```
$ docker push spccloud.azurecr.io/cloud-node:20-alpine3.17
```
After that, the image should have been successfully updated. You need to either request the access to Azure container instance management or ask me to restart the container instance.
